# Code_Quiz

## User Story
To create a functional JavaScript timed quiz.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

## Challenges
Creating a game from scratch was difficult and getting each button to be fully functional was difficult as well.
